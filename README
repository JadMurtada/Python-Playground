Python Playgroun  :-D

Here are some of the things I'd like to do:

* sampler code for various predictive methods on various data sets
  including statistics about the effectiveness of that model for 
  that data set.  I will be using free data time series data sets
  from DataMarket.com.

* sudoku generator

* pixel logic game

* more to come later.  Any suggestions?
